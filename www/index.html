		<div>ClimateMaster Geothermal Systems The ground absorbs nearly half of the solar energy our planet receives. As a result, the earth remains at a constant, moderate temperature just below its surface all year round. However, air temperature varies greatly from summer to winter, making air source (traditional) heating and cooling least efficient when you need it the most. 

Geothermal heating and cooling systems take advantage of the stable temperature underground using a piping system, commonly referred to as a “loop.” Water circulates in the loop to exchange heat between your home, the geothermal heat pump, and the earth, providing heating, cooling, and hot water at remarkably high efficiencies. In fact, ClimateMaster geothermal heating and cooling systems are 400-600% efficient and can cut your heating, cooling, and hot water costs by up to 80%. 

Geothermal HeatingDuring the winter, ClimateMaster geothermal heating and cooling systems absorb heat stored in the ground through the water that circulates in its underground loop. This heat is carried to the geothermal heat pump where it’s concentrated and then sent as warm, comfortable air throughout your home. 

When you need heating the most, the air outside is coldest. As a result, a traditional air source heat pump works hard to extract the amount of heat from the cold air needed to properly heat your home. In contrast, a geothermal system consumes less energy as it easily absorbs heat from the abundant supply stored below ground, making geothermal heating significantly more energy efficient. 

Gas furnaces burn natural gas to provide heat for your home and are only 98% efficient, while geothermal systems use significantly less energy collecting heat from the earth, achieving 400-600% efficiencies. 

Geothermal Cooling During the summer, ClimateMaster geothermal heating and cooling systems absorb heat from your home and transfers it to the underground loop where it is then absorbed by the cooler earth. The geothermal heat pump uses the cool water returning from the earth to create cool, dehumidified air for your home. 

When you need cooling the most, the outside air is hottest. A traditional air source heat pump must work hard to force the heat from your home into the already heat saturated air. In contrast, a geothermal heat pump consumes less energy as it easily rejects heat into the cool earth, making geothermal cooling significantly more energy efficient.
